\title{Select the best Time Series model}
\usage{
select_TS(TS_models, control = TS_controls_list())
}
\arguments{
\item{TS_models}{An object of class \code{TS_on_LDA} produced by
\code{\link{TS_on_LDA}}.}

\item{control}{Class \code{TS_controls} list including (named) elements
corresponding to the \code{measurer} and \code{evaluator} functions, 
as generated by \code{\link{TS_controls_list}}.}
}
\value{
A reduced version of \code{TS_models} that only includes the 
  selected TS model. The returned object is a single TS model object of
  class \code{TS_fit}.
}
\description{
Select the best model of interest from an
  \code{TS_on_LDA} object generated by \code{\link{TS_on_LDA}}, based on
  a set of user-provided functions. The functions default to choosing the 
  model with the lowest AIC value. \cr \cr
  Presently, the set of functions should result in a singular selected
  model. If multiple models are chosen via the selection, only the first
  is returned.
