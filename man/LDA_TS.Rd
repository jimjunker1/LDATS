\usage{
LDA_TS(document_term_table, document_covariate_table, topics = 2,
  nseeds = 1, formulas = ~1, nchangepoints = 0,
  weights = document_weights(document_term_table),
  control = LDA_TS_controls_list())
}
\arguments{
\item{document_term_table}{Table of observation count data (rows: 
documents (\eqn{M}), columns: terms (\eqn{V})). May be a class 
\code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} but must be conformable to
a code of integers. This table is a document-level summary of the data 
noted as \eqn{w} (the word-level topic identity) in the math description.}

\item{document_covariate_table}{Document covariate table (rows:
documents (\code{M}), columns: time index and covariate options). 
Every model needs a covariate to describe the time value for each
document (in whatever relevant units), whose name in the table is input
via \code{timename}, that dictates the application of the changepoints. 
In addition, the table needs to include as columns all covariates named 
within the specific models described via the argument \code{formula} 
(if desired). Must be a conformable to a data table.}

\item{topics}{Vector of the number of topics to evaluate in the LDAs.}

\item{nseeds}{Integer number of seeds (replicate starts) to use for each 
value of \code{topics} in the LDAs.}

\item{formulas}{Vector of \code{formula}(s) for the continuous change. Any 
predictor variable included in a formula must also be a column in the
\code{document_covariate_table}. Each element (formula) in the vector
is evaluated for each number of change points and each LDA model.}

\item{nchangepoints}{Vector of integers corresponding to the number of 
change points to include in the model. 0 is a valid input (corresponding
to no change points, so a singular time series model), and the current 
implementation can reasonably include up to 6 change points. Each element 
(number of change points) in the vector is used to dictate the
segementation of the data  for each continuous model and each LDA model.}

\item{weights}{Optional class \code{numeric} vector of weights for each 
document. Corresponds to the vector \strong{\eqn{v}} in the math 
description. Defaults to value calculated by 
\code{\link{document_weights}}, but can be set as \code{NULL}.}

\item{control}{Class \code{LDA_TS_controls} list that contains 
\code{LDA_controls}, \code{TS_controls}, and the top-level \code{quiet}.}
}
\value{
Class \code{LDA_TS} object including all fitted models and selected 
  models specifically.
}
\description{
This function runs a complete suite of Latent Dirichlet
  Allocation (LDA) models (via \code{\link{LDA_set}}), selects the choice
  LDA model(s) (via \code{\link{select_LDA}}), runs a complete set of Time 
  Series (TS) models (via \code{\link{TS_on_LDA}}) on the choice LDA
  model(s), then selects the best TS model (via \code{select_TS}).
