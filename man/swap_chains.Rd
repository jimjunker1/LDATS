\title{Conduct a set of among-chain swaps for the ptMCMC algorithm}
\usage{
swap_chains(chainsin, inputs, ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{chainsin}{Chain configuration to be evaluated for swapping.}

\item{inputs}{Class \code{ptMCMC_inputs} list, containing the static inputs
for use within the ptMCMC algorithm.}

\item{ids}{The vector of integer chain ids.}
}
\value{
List of updated changepoints, log-likelihoods, and chain ids, as 
  well as a vector of acceptance indicators for each swap.
}
\description{
This function handles the among-chain swapping based on 
  temperatures and likelihood differentials.  
  \cr \cr
  This function was designed to work within \code{\link{TS}} and 
  specifically \code{\link{est_changepts}}. It is still hardcoded to do
  so, but has the capacity to be generalized to work with any estimation
  via ptMCMC with additional coding work.
}
\details{
The ptMCMC algorithm couples the chains (which are 
  taking their own walks on the distribution surface) through "swaps", 
  where neighboring chains exchange configurations (Geyer 1991, Falcioni 
  and Deem 1999) following the Metropolis criterion (Metropolis 
  \emph{et al.} 1953). This allows them to share information and search the
  surface in combination (Earl and Deem 2005).
