\title{Multinomial Time Series analysis of a topic model classification}
\usage{
MTS(data, formula = ~1, nchangepoints = 1, weights = NULL, nit = 10000,
  magnitude = 12, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame including the predictor and response variables}

\item{formula}{formula for the continuous change equation}

\item{nchangepoints}{number of change points to include in the model}

\item{weights}{weights}

\item{nit}{number of iterations used}

\item{magnitude}{scaling for the kick magnitude used in the proposal dist}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to subfunctions}
}
\value{
a lot of stuff in a list. this needs to be tidied
