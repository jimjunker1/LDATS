really chunk out the main MTS function

make memoise a logical toggle option
put mcmc control options in general into a list or something

figure out as going along if there's going to be a moderately easy way to 
make it possible to swap out for other flavors of mcmc or nah

set up a much better toggle for 0 change points
it won't need to unconditional estimation either etc etc
